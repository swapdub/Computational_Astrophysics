# Computational_Astrophysics
My graduate level course in computational astrophysics I took in my final year at Penn State as an Astrophysics Major.

Projects in this course include implementing algorithms like: 
- MCMC algorithms
- Lorentzian and Gaussian fitting
- Lagrangian and Cubic Natural Spline interpolation functions
- N-body simulation using Leap frog algorithm
- Machine Learning using Keras from tensorflow


Using these we attempt to study and simulate phenomenon relating to astrophysical concepts.
